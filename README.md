# vanillajs-student-directory
 A directory of students, with pagination

This app uses vanilla JavaScript to dynamically generate the markup for a student list
and pagination buttons within a generic student directory. It has two primary functions,
'showPage' and 'addPagination.' The default number of students displayed per page is 9, 
and the sample data file contains an array of 42 student 'objects.' The app is flexible 
enough to accept student data files of varying sizes.
